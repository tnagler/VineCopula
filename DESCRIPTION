Package: VineCopula
Type: Package
Title: Statistical Inference of Vine Copulas
Version: 2.0.0
Description: Tools for bivariate exploratory data analysis, bivariate copula
    selection and (vine) tree construction are provided. Vine copula models can
    be estimated either sequentially or by joint maximum likelihood estimation.
    Sampling algorithms and plotting methods are included. Data is assumed to
    lie in the unit hypercube (so-called copula data). For C- and D-vines links
    to the package 'CDVine' are provided.
