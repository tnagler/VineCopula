\item{p.value}{So far no p-value is returned nigher a asymptotic nor a

only available for the Anderson-Darling test statistic if the R-package
\code{ADGofTest} is loaded. \cr
Furthermore, a asymptotic p-value can be
calculated for the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test statistic. For the Cramer-von
Mises no asymptotic p-value is available so far.}

\item{CvM, KS}{test statistic according to the
choice of \code{statistic}}
\item{p.value}{bootstrapped p-value} \cr
Warning: The code for all the p-values are not yet approved since some of them are
moved from R-code to C-code. If you need p-values the best way is to write your own
algorithm as suggested in Schepsmeier (2013) to get bootstrapped p-values.

\description{
This function performs a goodness-of-fit test for R-vine copula models.
There are 15 different goodness-of-fit tests implemented, described in
Schepsmeier (2013).
}
\details{
\code{method = "White"}: \cr
This goodness-of fit test uses the information
matrix equality of White (1982) and was original investigated by Huang and
Prokhorov (2011) for copulas. \cr
Schepsmeier (2012) enhanced their approach
to the vine copula case. \cr
The main contribution is that under correct
model specification the Fisher Information can be equivalently calculated as
minus the expected Hessian matrix or as the expected outer product of the
score function.
The null hypothesis is
\deqn{ H_0: \boldsymbol{H}(\theta) + \boldsymbol{C}(\theta) = 0 }{H_0:
H(\theta) + C(\theta) = 0 }
against the alternative
\deqn{ H_1: \boldsymbol{H}(\theta) +
\boldsymbol{C}(\theta) \neq 0 , }{H_1: H(\theta) + C(\theta) != 0, }
where
\eqn{\boldsymbol{H}(\theta)}{H(\theta)} is the expected Hessian matrix and
\eqn{\boldsymbol{C}(\theta)}{C(\theta)} is the expected outer product of the
score function. \cr
For the calculation of the test statistic we use the
consistent maximum likelihood estimator \eqn{\hat{\theta}} and the sample
counter parts of \eqn{\boldsymbol{H}(\theta)}{H(\theta)} and
\eqn{\boldsymbol{C}(\theta)}{C(\theta)}. \cr
The correction of the
Covariance-Matrix in the test statistic for the uncertainty in the margins
is skipped. The implemented test assumes that there is no uncertainty in the
margins. The correction can be found in Huang and Prokhorov (2011) for
bivariate copulas and in Schepsmeier (2013) for vine copulas. It involves
multi-dimensional integrals. \cr

\code{method = "IR"}: \cr
As the White test the information matrix ratio
test is based on the expected Hessian matrix
\eqn{\boldsymbol{H}(\theta)}{H(\theta)}
and the expected outer product of
the score function \eqn{\boldsymbol{C}(\theta)}{C(\theta)}. \cr
\deqn{ H_0:-\boldsymbol{H}(\theta)^{-1}\boldsymbol{C}(\theta) = I_{p} }{H_0:
-H(\theta)^{-1}C(\theta) = I_p}
against the alternative
\deqn{ H_1:
-\boldsymbol{H}(\theta)^{-1}\boldsymbol{C}(\theta) \neq I_{p} . }{H_1:
-H(\theta)^{-1}C(\theta) != I_p.}
The test statistic can then be calculated as
\deqn{ IR_n:=tr(\Phi(\theta))/p } with
\eqn{\Phi(\theta)=-\boldsymbol{H}(\theta)^{-1}\boldsymbol{C}(\theta)}{\Phi(\theta)=-H(\theta)^{-1}C(\theta)},
\eqn{p} is the number of parameters, i.e. the length of \eqn{\theta}, and
\eqn{tr(A)} is the trace of the matrix \eqn{A} \cr
For details see Schepsmeier (2013) \cr

\code{method = "Breymann"}, \code{method = "Berg"} and \code{method =
"Berg2"}: \cr
These tests are based on the multivariate probability integral
transform (PIT) applied in \code{\link{RVinePIT}}. The multivariate data
\eqn{y_{i}} returned form the PIT are aggregated to univariate data by
different aggregation functions \eqn{\Gamma(\cdot)} in the sum \deqn{
s_t=\sum_{i=1}^d \Gamma(y_{it}), t=1,...,n }.
In Breymann et al. (2003) the weight function is suggested as
\eqn{\Gamma(\cdot)=\Phi^{-1}(\cdot)^2}{\Gamma(y)=\Phi^{-1}y^2}, while in
Berg and Bakken (2007) the weight function is either
\eqn{\Gamma(\cdot)=|\cdot-0.5|}{\Gamma(y)=|y-0.5|} (\code{method="Berg"}) or
\eqn{\Gamma(\cdot)=(\cdot-0.5)^{\alpha},\alpha=2,4,6,...}{\Gamma(y)=(y-0.5)^{\alpha},\alpha=2,4,6,...}
(\code{method="Berg2"}). \cr Furthermore, the \code{"Berg"} and
\code{"Berg2"} test are based on the order statistics of the PIT returns.
\cr See Berg and Bakken (2007) or Schepsmeier (2013) for details. \cr

\code{method = "ECP"} and \code{method = "ECP2"}: \cr
Both tests are test
for \eqn{H_0: C \in C_0} against \eqn{H_1: C \notin C_0} where C denotes the
(vine) copula distribution function and \eqn{C_0} is a class of parametric
(vine) copulas with \eqn{\Theta\subseteq R^p} being the parameter space of
dimension p. They are based on the empirical copula process (ECP)
\deqn{
\hat{C}_n(u)-C_{\hat{\theta}_n}(u), }
with
\eqn{u=(u_1,\ldots,u_d)\in[0,1]^d} and
\eqn{\hat{C}_n(u) =
\frac{1}{n+1}\sum_{t=1}^n \boldsymbol{1}_{\{U_{t1}\leq u_1,\ldots,U_{td}\leq
u_d \}} }{\hat{C}_n(u) = 1/(n+1)\sum_{t=1}^n 1_{U_{t1}\leq
u_1,\ldots,U_{td}\leq u_d} }.
The ECP is utilized in a multivariate
Cramer-von Mises (CvM) or multivariate Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) based test
statistic. An extension of the ECP-test is the combination of the
multivariate PIT approach with the ECP. The general idea is that the
transformed data of a multivariate PIT should be "close" to the independence
copula Genest et al. (2009). Thus a distance of CvM or KS type between them
is considered. This approach is called ECP2. Again we refer to Schepsmeier
(2013) for details.
