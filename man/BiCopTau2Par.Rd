\title{Parameter of a Bivariate Copula for a given Kendall's Tau Value}
\usage{
BiCopTau2Par(family, tau, check.taus = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{family}{integer; single number or vector of size \code{n}; defines the
bivariate copula family: \cr \code{0} = independence copula \cr \code{1} =
Gaussian copula \cr \code{2} = Student t copula (Here only the first
parameter can be computed) \cr \code{3} = Clayton copula \cr \code{4} =
Gumbel copula \cr \code{5} = Frank copula \cr \code{6} = Joe copula \cr
\code{13} = rotated Clayton copula (180 degrees; \verb{survival Clayton'') \\cr `14` = rotated Gumbel copula (180 degrees; }survival Gumbel'') \cr
\code{16} = rotated Joe copula (180 degrees; ``survival Joe'') \cr \code{23}
= rotated Clayton copula (90 degrees) \cr `24` = rotated Gumbel copula
(90 degrees) \cr `26` = rotated Joe copula (90 degrees) \cr `33` =
rotated Clayton copula (270 degrees) \cr `34` = rotated Gumbel copula
(270 degrees) \cr `36` = rotated Joe copula (270 degrees)\cr Note that
(with exception of the t-copula) two parameter bivariate copula families
cannot be used.}

\item{tau}{numeric; single number or vector of size \code{n}; Kendall's tau
value (vector with elements in \eqn{[-1,1]}).}

\item{check.taus}{logical; default is \code{TRUE}; if \code{FALSE}, checks
for family/tau-consistency are omitted (should only be used with care).}

\description{
This function computes the parameter of a (one parameter) bivariate copula
for a given value of Kendall's tau.
}
\note{
The number \code{n} can be chosen arbitrarily, but must agree across
arguments.

## Example 1: Gaussian copula
tau0 <- 0.5
rho <- BiCopTau2Par(family = 1, tau = tau0)
BiCop(1, tau = tau0)$par  # alternative

## Example 2:
vtau <- seq(from = 0.1, to = 0.8, length.out = 100)
thetaC <- BiCopTau2Par(family = 3, tau = vtau)
thetaG <- BiCopTau2Par(family = 4, tau = vtau)
thetaF <- BiCopTau2Par(family = 5, tau = vtau)
thetaJ <- BiCopTau2Par(family = 6, tau = vtau)
plot(thetaC ~ vtau, type = "l", ylim = range(thetaF))
lines(thetaG ~ vtau, col = 2)
lines(thetaF ~ vtau, col = 3)
lines(thetaJ ~ vtau, col = 4)

## Example 3: different copula families
theta <- BiCopTau2Par(family = c(3,4,6), tau = c(0.4, 0.5, 0.6))
BiCopPar2Tau(family = c(3,4,6), par = theta)
